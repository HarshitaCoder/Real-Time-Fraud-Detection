# Real-Time-Fraud-Detection
## Overview  
This project is a Real-Time Fraud Detection System that identifies fraudulent transactions using machine learning. The system processes incoming transaction data, trains a classification model, and detects fraudulent activities in real-time. It is built using **Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Machine Learning algorithms.

## Dataset  
The system uses the `creditcard.csv` dataset, which contains real-world credit card transactions. It includes:  
- Features (V1-V28) – Anonymized transaction details.  
- Time – Transaction timestamp.  
- Amount – Transaction amount.  
- Class – Target variable (`0` for normal transactions, `1` for fraud).  

## Key Features  
✅ Data Preprocessing:  
   - Handles missing values (if any).  
   - Normalizes transaction amounts.  
   - Splits data into training and testing sets.  

✅ Machine Learning Model:  
   - Trains a Random Forest Classifier to detect fraud.  
   - Addresses class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).  
   - Evaluates performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  

✅ Real-Time Prediction:  
   - Simulates a real-time fraud detection system by analyzing new transactions dynamically.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)  

## How It Works  
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.  
2. Train a fraud detection model.  
3. Evaluate the model’s performance.  
4. Deploy real-time fraud detection by analyzing new transactions.  

## Future Improvements  
🚀 Deep Learning Integration – Implement LSTMs or Autoencoders for fraud detection.  
📊 Better Feature Engineering – Improve model accuracy with additional insights.  
🛠️ Deploy as a Web App – Create a Flask-based fraud detection API.
